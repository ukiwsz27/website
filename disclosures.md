EthStaker's mission is to educate the staking community and encourage a healthy network. While stewards try to be as unbiased as possible when making decisions, they do have active roles and investments in projects and services. We believe in transparency and want to disclose these roles and investments.

The most valuable asset we own is our reputation. As Vitalik says, [the most important resource is legitimacy](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html), and we aim to protect that. We will never let holdings bias lead us from our core mission: to maximize decentralization of the Ethereum network.

Hold us accountable for this.
